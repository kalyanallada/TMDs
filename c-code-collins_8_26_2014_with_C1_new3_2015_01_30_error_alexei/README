THE USAGE OF THE PROGRAM


collins.exe -DATA 0

will generate and store pseudodata assigning experimental error to the calculation with the best fit 
at each kinematical bin

it also calculates and stores denominator for asymmetries needed at the next step


collins.exe -NO 10

will use parameter set 10 and calculate chi^2 and store information on transversity U and D and the values for tensor charge at 10 GeV^2

The values of chi2 are in a file

chi2_10.dat

The format is 

set_number set_used   chi2_pim  number_pim_bins  chi2_pip   number_pip_bins   chi2_pim + chi2_pip   number_pim_bins + number_pip_bins 


Transversity is in

transversity_u_10.dat
transversity_d_10.dat

The format

x x*h_u(x)

x x*h_d(x)
