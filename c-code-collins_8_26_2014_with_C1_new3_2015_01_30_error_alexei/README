THE USAGE OF THE PROGRAM


collins.exe -DATA 0

will generate and store pseudodata assigning experimental error to the calculation with the best fit 
at each kinematical bin

it also calculates and stores denominator for asymmetries needed at the next step


collins.exe -NO 10

will use parameter set 10 and calculate chi^2 and store information on transversity U and D and the values for tensor charge at 10 GeV^2
